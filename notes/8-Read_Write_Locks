读写锁

A mutex lock blocks all other threads from entering what we call a critical region. This
critical region usually involves accessing or updating one or more pieces of data that are
shared between the threads. But sometimes, we can distinguish between reading a piece
of data and modifying a piece of data.

1. Any number of threads can hold a given read-write lock for reading as long as
no thread holds the read-write lock for writing.
2. A read-write lock can be allocated for writing only if no thread holds the
read-write lock for reading or writing.

In some applications, the data is read more often than the data is modified, and
these applications can benefit from using read-write locks instead of mutex locks.
