The three types of IPC,
    Posix message queues (Chapter 5),
    Posix semaphores (Chapter 10), and
    Posix shared memory (Chapter 13)

IPC Names
we noted that the three types of Posix IPC use "Posix IPC names" for their
identification. The first argument to the three functions mq_open, sem_open, and
shm_open is such a name, which may or may not be a real pathname in a filesystem.

IPC 名字会导致可移植性问题。
解决方法：定义一个生成name的函数，根据不同的平台生成不同的名字。
