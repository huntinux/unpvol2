Pipe:
the original form of Unix IPC;
their fundamental limitation is that they have no name, and 
can therefore be used only by related processes.

Fifo: named pipe

Both pipes and FIFOs are accessed using the normal read and write functions

Pipes
    #include <unistd.h>
    int pipe (int fd[2]);
    Two file descriptors are returned: fd[0], which is open for reading, and fd[1], which is
    open for writing

The S_ISFIFO macro can be used to determine if a descriptor or file is either a pipe
or a FIFO. Its single argument is the st_mode member of the stat structure and the
macro evaluates to true (nonzero)or false (0). For a pipe, this structure is filled in by the
fstat function. For a FIFO, this structure is filled in by the fstat , lstat , or stat
functions.
